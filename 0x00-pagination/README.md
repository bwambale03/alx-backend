# Pagination Project

This project implements different strategies for paginating data in Python. Pagination is essential for efficiently handling large datasets by splitting the data into manageable chunks. The project covers simple pagination, hypermedia pagination, and deletion-aware pagination.

## Project Structure

- **0-main.py**: Entry point to test the different pagination methods implemented.
- **0-simple_helper_function.py**: Contains helper functions used for simple pagination.
- **1-simple_pagination.py**: Implements a simple pagination method that divides the data into pages of a specified size.
- **2-hypermedia_pagination.py**: Introduces hypermedia pagination, which provides additional metadata and links to navigate between pages.
- **3-hypermedia_del_pagination.py**: Enhances the hypermedia pagination by being aware of deleted entries, ensuring consistency in pagination despite deletions.
- **__pycache__**: Directory containing cached Python bytecode files.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
